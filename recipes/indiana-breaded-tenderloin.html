            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li>Flatten pork slices, one at a time, by placing in between two pieces of sturdy plastic and pounding with a meat mallet until 1/4-inch thich and about 3 1/2x5 inches in size.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow bowl; stir in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt,  marjoram, and oregano until well blended. Place bread crumbs into another shallow bowl.</li>
                <li>Dip each flattened cutlet into seasoned egg mixture, then dip into bread crumbs until thoroughly coated. Set breaded cutlets in a single layer on a piece of parchment or waxed paper.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet until shimmering. Gently lower cutlets into the hot skillet and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place kaiser rolls, split-sides up, onto a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Broil in the preheated oven until toasted and hot, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and assemble sandwiches: Place fried cutlets on roll bottoms.</li>
                <li>Add toppings in the desired order: mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, and lettuce. Top sandwiches with roll tops and serve.</li>
